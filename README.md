### Netflix EDA Case Study

**Problem Statement:**  
The objective was to clean, preprocess, and analyze data from 6,234 Netflix titles to gain insights into content trends and genre dynamics. The challenge was to handle missing values, ensure data accuracy, and derive meaningful patterns from the dataset.

**Target Metrics:**  
- **Data Accuracy:** Achieve a high level of completeness and consistency in the dataset.
- **Insight Generation:** Identify key trends and patterns in Netflix content, such as popular genres and content distribution.
- **Visualization Quality:** Create clear and informative visualizations to support data-driven insights.

**Approach:**  
- **Data Cleaning:** Utilized pandas for preprocessing, including handling missing values and standardizing data formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Employed matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations such as distribution plots and bar charts to explore content trends and genre dynamics.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applied NumPy for basic statistical analysis to quantify insights and validate findings.

**Results:**  
- **Data Accuracy:** Improved dataset accuracy by addressing inconsistencies and filling missing values, leading to a reliable analysis.
- **Insight Generation:** Identified trends such as the most popular genres and the distribution of titles over time.
- **Visualization Quality:** Developed informative visualizations that highlighted key trends and patterns, aiding in the understanding of Netflix content dynamics.

**Proposed Improvements:**  
- **Further Data Enrichment:** Incorporate additional data sources, such as user ratings and reviews, to enhance the analysis.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Apply machine learning techniques to predict content trends and user preferences.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Develop interactive dashboards for dynamic exploration of content trends and genre distributions.
